<h1>racism from ferguson in social media</h1>
<h3>how this situation is controversial and can be interpreted many ways</h3>
![Ferguson](/images/ferguson.jpg)

A couple of hours ago, the grand jury in charge of the case of the shooting of Michael Brown ruled not to indict Darren Wilson, the white police officer who killed Brown leading to numerous riots in the Ferguson area. After this announcement, social media completely blew up. People took both sides of the argument, throwing out extremely racist and one sided comments. Typically I ignore such bullshit in which both sides get facts wrong or don't consider counterarguments, but this event is worth talking about.


<h3>why does it matter?</h3>
I consistently see comments from both good friends of mine and those I don't even know scrolling down my timeline talking about the recent ruling. Twitter is a means of quick communication and thoughts that quickly come to the front of your mind, and is okay to say things that may not be 100% valid or accurate. This is fine to a point, but when people are being blatantly racist or stereotypical things should be clarified.


<h3>so what are people saying?</h3>
>race had no involvement in this case- it was an issue of murder only

>united states is not a free country from racism

>all white people are racist towards blacks/ all blacks are racist towards whites

>black lives don't matter to americans

>justice system did its job

>justice system is corrupt

>brown was black, wilson was white: no case. but what about the opposite?

>white people cannot talk about this because they are not the majority

>violence will not change this decision

>cop vs civilian or black vs white


<h3>thats quite the wide range of opinions. what does each side have arguing for them?</h3>
>race had no involvement in this case- it was an issue of murder only

Lets disregard race and just summarize what happened and see where we stand. 
A man steals some stuff from a convenience store. The description of the subject was disclosed over police radio. A policemen is doing his route, and after commenting to some teenagers to stop walking down the middle of the street, likely identifies the subject. A physical altercation occurs and a gun is fired. Feeling threatened, and with the subject possible not cooperating, he was shot and killed.

Obviously this is generalized and missing a lot of odd information that gives this case some interesting quirks. However, no matter which side you fall on, can view this and agree there could be a chance of a case and arguments for each side. That's without including race. 

>united states is not a free country from racism

No its not. But it sure is a hell lot more free than counties with civil wars occurring in them. No matter how oppressed you feel in the USA you know there are rights you have that some could only dream of. That doesn't make it right but is something to consider.

>all white people are racist towards blacks/ all blacks are racist towards whites

??? really. People make generalizations but if you honestly believe this stop cowering under your rock.

>black lives don't matter to americans

False. I would argue all lives matter to anyone. There are some ignorant racist people out there who want to make trouble, and these are the people you hear from. The tiny small minority tends to make the most trouble and misrepresents the larger group in any situation.

>justice system did its job

Maybe. Maybe not. We don't know 100% and will never know. 

>justice system is corrupt

Probably, but so is our government. Changes do need to be made and this helps them become more aware of what needs to be changed.

>brown was black, wilson was white: no case. but what about the opposite?

Could be likely, but there are many factors to consider. Race is one, however. See below.

>white people cannot talk about this because they are not the majority

This is hard for me to counter because I myself am white but I think well knowledgeable and educated peoples about the subject for any topic will be able to intelligently talk about it.

>violence will not change this decision

No it won't. If you burn the American flag you get whatever consequences come from you. Peaceful protest helps raise awareness of the issue however. Never fight fire with fire. 

>cop vs civilian or black vs white

See below


<h3>are these arguments about ferguson or something deeper?</h3>
Many people are upset about the murder and they should be. A young man was murdered where it was probably unnecessary even in a physical altercation. The issues that Ferguson has shown the world is that there is still lots of racial tension between many people. No one likes to admit it is there, but it is, and the reason that this story became so important is because of what it represents to many. A white person being powerful over a black and getting away with it. it shows the injustice in our society. To many, this is what the case represents. Once this is the mindset, some whites felt threatened by this and made a negative response that was often not met kindly. Anyone involved in this made a mistake at some point. This case stands for a lot, and shows some of the uglier sides of society.


<h3>what are your personal feelings of the ruling?</h3>
This is such a controversial topic, and with these sorts of topics one needs to tread lightly and make sure they are as unbiased as one could possibly be. It makes an argument less infuriating to read, and can actually make one aware why the other side is saying the things they have been. Arguments need to consider sides you may personally disagree with, but still need to address to not make it one sided.
Before this announcement I fully expected this case to go to trial. It surprised me that it didn't, but at the same time I still saw it as a possibility. The jury made the final decision and whether or not they had more information than what is publicly available the decision will stand. Is the jury racist? I have no clue. Is the case racist? People will still draw different conclusions on this. The question about whether this case is only about race is still important to ask, although I don't think it is what everyone should be solely focused on. There are likely injustices in this event. If the races were switched it probably would have gone to trial. It sucks to admit but there is still racism in this world. For those who say there isn't, you are likely part of the problem. For those of you who say its worse than it has ever been, remember the civil rights movement and how much has been accomplished even in the last 100 years. There is still things this country can work on as a whole, and arguing and bickering will not fix these issues. Skin color is just that- a color. Continuing to generalize and hate and stereotype because of color will get as much done as someone bailing out the Titanic with a spoon. 

<h3>final note</h3>
I researched this a little before writing, I did not pull this stuff out of my ass. I didn't really chime in much on Twitter, because currently this post is at 7,500 characters. That's not going to fit in a tweet spree. I tried to keep all of my arguments as unbiased as possible, and get to the root of the problem. If you disagree with what I say tweet me at [@inickt6](http://twitter.com/inickt6) or send me an [email](mailto:me@nickthompson.guru).
