<h1>racism from ferguson in social media</h1>
<h3>how this situation is controversial and can be interpreted many ways</h3>
![Ferguson](/images/ferguson.jpg)

A couple of hours ago, the grand jury in charge of the case of the shooting of Michael Brown ruled not to indict Darren Wilson, the white police officer who killed Brown leading to numerous riots in the Ferguson area. After this announcement, social media completely blew up. People took both sides of the argument, throwing out extremely racist and one sided comments. Typically I ignore such bullshit in which both sides get facts wrong or don't consider counterarguments, but this event is worth talking about.

<h3>why does it matter?</h3>
I consistently see comments from both good friends of mine and those I don't even know scrolling down my timeline talking about the recent ruling. Twitter is a means of quick communication and thoughts that quickly come to the front of your mind, and is okay to say things that may not be 100% valid or accurate. This is fine to a point, but when people are being blatantly racist or stereotypical things should be clarified.

<h3>so what are people saying?</h3>
>race had no involvement in this case- it was an issue of murder only

>united states is not a free country

>all white people are racist towards blacks

>black lives don't matter to americans

>justice system did its job

>justice system is corrupt

>brown was black, wilson was white: no case. but what about the opposite?

>cop vs civilian or black vs white

>white people cannot talk about this because they are not the majority

>violence will not change this decision

<h3>thats quite the wide range of opinions. what does each side have arguing for them?</h3>

<h3>what are your personal feelings of the ruling?</h3>
This is such a controversial topic, and with these sorts of topics one needs to tread lightly and make sure they are as unbiased as one could possibly be. It makes an argument less infuriating to read, and
