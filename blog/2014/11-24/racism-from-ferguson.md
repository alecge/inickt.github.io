<h3>how this situation is controversial and can be interpreted many ways</h3>
![Ferguson](/images/ferguson.jpg)

A couple of hours ago, the grand jury in charge of the case of the shooting of Michael Brown ruled not to indict Darren Wilson, the white police officer who killed Brown leading to numerous riots in the Ferguson area. After this announcement, social media completely blew up. People took both sides of the argument, throwing out extremely racist and one sided comments. Typically I ignore such bullshit in which both sides get facts wrong or don't consider counterarguments, but this event is worth talking about.
