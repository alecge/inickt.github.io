<!-- Help Summary -->
<div class="container">
	<p>
		I am a junior in high school and have a very strong passion for technology. From a young age I was curious as to how computers work and technology in general. I have self taught myself anything from programming to building computers from scratch. 
	</p>
	<p>
I often see a lot of frustration with technology from everyone young to old. Technology can be a beneficial tool, but when it doesn't work for your needs it can be a mess. I strive to make computers accessible to everyone, and making sure the problem is fixed without the frustrations or price tag other services like Geek Squad can carry.

	<!-- Services -->
	<h2>Services Available</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Computer Tutoring</strong> - I can help walk anyone through programs such as the Microsoft Office Suite, email, or new devices to make sure you know how to use them effectively.</li>
		<li><strong>Smartphone Assistance</strong> - I can assist with how to use your iPhone or Android based phone through apps and default services provided.</li>
		<li><strong>Virus/Malware Removal</strong> - I am able to clean up computers heavily infected with malware and viruses.</li>
		<li><strong>Computer Cleanup</strong> - I can remove "bloatware", or unneeded programs that come with a new computer, along with other unused programs to make your computer faster.</li>
		<li><strong>Networking Repair and Setup</strong> - If you are having trouble with Wifi, or its range, or getting connected to the internet I can help resolve these issues.</li>
		<li><strong>Computer Restoration</strong> - Old computers may not always be ready to be retired. A couple new parts and a clean install of the operating system can make a computer run like new and save you money.</li>
		<li><strong>Hardware Upgrades</strong> - If something is making your computer less productive to you or not working, I can replace parts to make everything work much smoother and be a better experience.</li>
		<li><strong>Software Updates</strong> - Get updated to the latest software and security updates to make sure your computer isn't vulnerable to viruses and other issues.</li>
		<li><strong>Technology Buying Advice</strong> - Need a new phone or computer? I can give advice on which laptop, phone, TV, or any other device to buy and which will be the best fit.</li>
		<li><strong>Computer Building</strong> - Need a new desktop computer? I am capable of building computers from scratch which can be beneficial to making sure you get exactly what you want, along with knowing your computer can be upgraded easier and will last longer.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>I work in the Homewood-Flossmoor area in Illinois, and will work with you to schedule an appointment that works well for both of our schedules. I am very flexible and can even schedule multiple smaller sessions instead of one large one.</p>

		My goal with my services is to provide affordable and high quality assistance to make sure the problem wont reappear and that everything is solved correctly the first time around. I charge $30 an hour for all of my services, and I provide free evaluations with ballpark estimate for how much it will cost. This is better than some larger companies who will charge you $100 just for showing up, and they might not even fix the problem completely. If after an initial examination there is an issue that I can't fix, I will be able to point you in the correct direction.

I prefer them to Internet Explorer and Safari, however the newest versions of each are fine for basic use. I use Chrome because of its integration into the Google ecosystem.</li>
