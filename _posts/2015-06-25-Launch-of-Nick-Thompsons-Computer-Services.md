Today I am extremely happy to officially launch Nick Thompson's Computer Services and my website. Over the last few years I have toyed with the idea of creating a computer business to put my skills to good use, and I can finally say it is done. 

During the last couple months in my free time I have built this website from scratch, knowing nothing beforehand and teaching myself web design to make it. It includes [information about me][About], [some of my graphic design work][Portfolio], [my blog][Blog], [contact information][Contact], and future room for me to put my programming projects.

The main focus for my website, however, is to host [information about my computer business][Services]. My goal with Nick Thompson's Computer Services is to provide helpful and reliable technology assistance, for an affordable price that makes sure the problem is solved completely and correctly. I have always had family members and neighbors struggle with some tech issues even after hiring professional services that charge a lot and don't always have a clear solution. I aim to eliminate these issues. I have self taught myself everything I know about technology, and have not run into a problem I have not been able to solve yet. I am also looking into getting certified by Microsoft in certain IT subject areas to make myself more credible and to expand the scope of what I can work on. If you want to learn more about my computer services I offer, [click here][Services]. If you have any questions, feel more than welcome to [contact me][Contact].

I am really excited about all of this and am hoping it takes off. It is something I really enjoy doing and I know my talents can be really helpful to many people. I have had a tremendous amount of support from everyone, and it has been vital in getting this started. If you would like to support me, please recommend me to anyone who needs computer assistance as well as [liking Nick Thompson's Computer Services on Facebook][Facebook]. Your referrals go a long way in making this dream a reality.
