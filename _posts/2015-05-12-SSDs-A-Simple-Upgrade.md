Your computer is getting slow. It takes minutes to simply turn on, and even longer when you go to launch a program. Besides cleaning up unnecessary programs or files or an operating system reinstall ([which I can provide][help]), one of the easiest things you can do to make your computer feel new again is to add a Solid State Drive (SSD) to it.

###But what is a SSD?
Traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) are composed of multiple spinning platers with a head that writes and reads data magnetically. There are actual physical moving parts in a HDD. A SSD is a newer technology that within the last couple years has just dropped into consumer's price range. It has no moving parts, which allows it to easily overpass HDDs in both read and write speeds. They are also more durable than HDDs, because the lack of moving parts means less can go wrong, especially when they are moved while in use. A SSD could reduce startup time of a computer from 2 minutes to 25 seconds.

###What are the drawbacks to using a SSD?
Price. HDDs can store much more data for $50 than a SSD can. However, prices have been falling rapidly over the past few years and are big enough now where the average person doesn't have to worry about storage space. If a new computer is not in the budget, it is one of the first things I recommend people to upgrade in their current computer, and for a pretty low price it can add a couple more years lifespan to a computer.

###How do you use a SSD?
The main things that should be stored on a SSD are the Operating System (Windows, Mac OS X) and programs. The main reason for this is that they are the biggest files and the quicker read speeds make everything load much quicker. Files like documents or pictures don't need to be stored on a SSD. They are smaller files and don't benefit greatly from the speed increase. 

There are a couple options when it comes to how a SSD can be used: Replace current HDD or use with existing HDD. In laptops, often times there is only 1 spot for a SSD due to the limited space. In this case everything can be transfered to the SSD from the HDD, given enough space, and then just put back into the computer. Sometimes for laptops I replace the DVD drive with the old drive, so you have the benefits of a lot of space, a quick drive, and save money. The only drawback is the lack of a DVD drive, which are getting phased out anyways and could always be attached through USB.

###Conclusion
I hope this gave you a quick overview about the benefits of a SSD. If this all seems too complicated don't worry, as [I can install SSDs and help upgrade your computer][help]. If you have any questions, shoot me an [email][email] or post a comment below.
