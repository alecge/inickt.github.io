<h2>Hi- I'm Nick.</h2>
<p>I'm a current sophmore at Northeastern University studying CS and math. I have a strong love for hockey and the Chicago Blackhawks, and am part of our club roller hockey team at school. </p>

<p>Some of my recent fun tech projects include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>updating my desktob to a quintuple boot: Windows 10, macOS Sierra as a Hackintosh, Ubuntu GNOME 17.04, Fedora 26, and Arch Linux.</li>
	<li>reconfiguring my home server to run ESXi with pfSense in a VM as my router and Ubuntu server running various applications</li>
	<li>scrounging up computer parts people are throwing out to use or resell</li>
	<li>I also do some local tech support for friends and family when I am home from school.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>If you are curious, my current daily computers are:</p>
