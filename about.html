	<h2>Hi- I'm Nick.</h2>
	<p>I am a 17 year old guy and live in Flossmoor, IL. I attend <a href="http://www.hfhighschool.org/">HF High School</a>, and will be a senior for the 2015-2016 school year. I am in the International Baccalaureate program, and have taken multiple AP classes. I play golf and hockey for HF, and am involved in <a href="http://www.hfhighschool.org/clubs-and-activities/operation-snowball-snowflake-snowflurries/"> Operation Snowball</a>, National Honors Society (NHS), Spanish National Honors Society (SNHS), president of Mu Alpha Theta (Math honors society) and am on the mathletes team. Some of my favorite classes at HF have been AP Computer Science, AP Calculus BC, and physics. I really enjoy the STEM subjects.</p>
	
	<p>I have been interested in computers and technology since I was a little kid. I was always experimenting and tried to figure out how things work all the time. I loved Legos and building different sets whenever I could. My first computer was what I believe a Macintosh II. I would sit on my moms lap for hours and figured out how the whole thing worked. Eventually I got a Dell desktop and started teaching myself some basic coding and taking apart the computer for fun. I would go to the library and check out 20 books on subjects like using Microsoft Office, or how to use Windows, and read them cover to cover in my free time. The rest is kind of history from there. I got more desktops, self taught myself languages like Java, and learned the ins and outs of how everything works. I have fluent experience with Windows, Macs, and anything Linux based. I haven't (yet) found a problem I haven't found a solution to. Everyone always asks me how I know what I know and really it is just because the passion I have for the subject and I find it enjoyable to learn new things. I often times find problems where one really doesn't exist before, and then try and find solutions to solve those problems. Such as this website. I had zero HTML and CSS experience but I would say it tuned out fairly well. Recently I have just built an entire computer from scratch for my dad and his business, and it was one of my most fun projects I have ever done.</p>
